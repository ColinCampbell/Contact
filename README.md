==================

An example SproutCore app built (quickly!) for the June 2011 San Francisco meetup. Feel free to fork and add functionality or solve problems. Make sure to implement new functionality in the branch system so people can step through from the simplest sc-init'ed app to a more complete app. The steps are as follows:

1. Add store and fixtures
2. Add view structure and initial templates
3. Add statechart structure
4. Implement FixturesDataSource and loading in the Ready state
5. Implement group & person states
6. Styling and ensuring bindings for group & person views work
7. Implement nested stores to allow saving and cancelling changes to groups or people
8. Added log in state
